## 📝 About Me
I am a **passion-driven**, self-taught software engineer with a background in IT. Web development and I began a serious relationship back in 2019, when I took Colt Steele's Web Development Boot Camp on Udemy. Previously, I tinkered with Swift and Python to solve creative problems in and outside of the workplace.
