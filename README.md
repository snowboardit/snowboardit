# Hi, I'm Max. 👋👨‍💻

I'm a software engineer and tech enthusiast based in Maine, where my wife, a data scientist, and I share a small rustic farm with our beloved greyhound, two curious cats, and a pair of horses. By day, you'll typically find me immersed in code, moving between programming languages and frameworks, crafting intuitive web applications, and tackling intriguing technical challenges.

Life isn't only about technology for me - I deeply value balance and staying curious. There's always a new hobby to explore or an old passion to revisit. Recently, I rekindled my love for soccer after a decade away and discovered joy in woodworking; a custom bed for our greyhound is my latest creation.

I'm also passionate about aviation and volunteer with a non-profit soaring club, helping others experience the thrill of flight. When stepping away from screens, I enjoy hands-on projects around our farm—whether that's setting up a new network in the barn or tending to the garden.

## 🚀 Annual Developer Goals
I thoroughly enjoy learning and understand its importance in succeeding as a developer. Since 2022, I've been reflecting on past achievements and planning what to learn in the new year. Here are my [2025 developer goals](https://github.com/snowboardit/goals/blob/master/2025/goals.md) ([all years](https://github.com/snowboardit/goals/blob/master/README.md)).
