### Welcome to my Github! 👋

**As a young, yet seasoned techie with 15+ years of computer experience, computers and technology have always been more than a hobby or career. They are my passion. You can find me building, maintaining, and troubleshooting enterprise IT systems, writing code for one of my many side-projects, or simply tinkering to learn something new. When I am not glued to a computer, ❄ I am enjoying the four full seasons of Maine, 🏂 snowboarding (Sugarloafer since ’02), ✈ flying gliders or airplanes, 👪 spending time with friends and family, or 🤸‍ doing a backflip somewhere.**
