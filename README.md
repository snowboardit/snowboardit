# Hi, I'm Max. 👋👨‍💻

I'm a Maine-based software engineer who loves building intuitive web apps, solving technical puzzles, and jumping between languages and frameworks at [Defendify](https://defendify.com/). Outside of code, I live on a small rustic farm with my wife, our greyhound, two cats, and a pair of horses. I split my time between hands-on projects, volunteering with an [aviation foundation](https://soarfranconia.org/), gardening, woodworking, and chasing old passions—like soccer after a ten-year break. Curiosity keeps life interesting, on and off the screen.

## 🚀 Annual Developer Goals
I thoroughly enjoy learning and understand its importance in succeeding as a developer. Since 2022, I've been reflecting on past achievements and planning what to learn in the new year. Here are my [2025 developer goals](https://github.com/snowboardit/goals/blob/master/2025/goals.md) ([all years](https://github.com/snowboardit/goals/blob/master/README.md)).
